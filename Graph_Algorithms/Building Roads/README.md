# [Building Roads](https://cses.fi/problemset/task/1666)
### Hint
* our task is to **connect all unconnected components** of the graph
* find one node from each unconnected components and create roads between them so that all can be reachable
* if there are **k** unconnected components then we need **k-1** roads to connect all of them
